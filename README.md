Second readers-writers problem

There are readers and writers. 
In endless cycle they sleep random time. 
After awake they starts to read or write.

When writer writes, no readers can read.

Only one writer can write at one time. 

If writer entered queue and waits for readers to leave resource, no more readers can enter resource.
